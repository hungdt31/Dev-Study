## Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Data Structures refer to the organization and management of data in a way that enables efficient access and modification. Algorithms, on the other hand, are step-by-step procedures designed to solve specific problems. Together, they provide a powerful toolkit  for programmers to tackle complex computational challenges
